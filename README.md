#javascript time-clock:  manage and report your worked hours on any project


Utilize the time-clock app: https://aaronrs2002.github.io/time-clock/

In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to convert a React.js application to vanilla JavaScript. Using a simple time-clock app as an example, I guide viewers through the entire conversion process, highlighting the differences in structure, logic, and styling between the two approaches. This tutorial is perfect for developers looking to understand the core principles behind frameworks or for those seeking lightweight, framework-free solutions. The finished app is available for free on GitHub to explore and customize.
